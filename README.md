<h1> Hi </h1>

This is just a <strong> copy</strong> of the project: https://codesandbox.io/s/h1rrv

The only purpose here is to study how the <strong>@react-spring/parallax </strong> plugin works. https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring




In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
